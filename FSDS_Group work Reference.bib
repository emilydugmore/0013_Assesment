It employs spatial bivariate correlations and spatial econometrics to understand the heterogeneous spatial relationship between established hotels and Airbnb for three kinds of local tourism destinations: sun and beach, nature-based, and city. The case study concerns the Canary Islands where a good mixture of these attractions can be found. The main conclusion drawn is that Airbnb regulation needs to distinguish the kind of tourism. More precisely, Airbnb supply overlaps established hotels in city tourism, but it does not so clearly in sun and beach nor nature-based destinations. Airbnb supply matches tourist visits spatial distribution better than established hotels in city and nature-based destinations, but not in sun and beach destinations, where the incumbent hotels are closer to the tourism resources. Finally, the results from the spatial econometrics model shows that population size and the number of tourist visits matters as determinants of Airbnb location. However, the main determinant is price, which has got a much larger elasticity.},

  abstract = {The `sharing economy' has become a new buzzword in urban life as digital technology companies set up online platforms to link together people and un- or underutilised assets with those seeking to rent them for short periods of time. While cloaked under the rhetoric of `sharing', the exchanges they foster are usually profit-driven. These economic activities are having profound impacts on urban environments as they disrupt traditional forms of hospitality, transport, service industry and housing. While critical debates have focused on the challenges that sharing economy activities bring to existing labour and economic practices, it is necessary to acknowledge that they also have increasingly significant impacts on planning policy and urban governance. Using the case of Airbnb in London, this article looks at how these sharing or platform economy companies are involved in encouraging governments to change existing regulations, in this case by deregulating short-term letting. This has important implications for planning enforcement. We examine how the challenges around obtaining data to enforce new regulations are being addressed by local councils who struggle to balance corporate interests with public good. Finally, we address proposals for using algorithms and big data as means of urban governance and argue that the schism between regulation and enforcement is opening up new digitally mediated spaces of informal practices in cities.},

The purpose of this research was to investigate such impacts by determining the extent to which Airbnb is used as a hotel substitute and to examine how Airbnb guests expect their accommodations to perform relative to hotels. Together, these analyses were intended to provide empirical insight into Airbnb's status as a disruptive innovation. The study involved an online survey of over 800 tourists who had used Airbnb within the previous year. Nearly two-thirds had used Airbnb as a hotel substitute. When considering traditional hotel attributes (e.g., cleanliness and comfort), Airbnb was generally expected to outperform budget hotels/motels, underperform upscale hotels, and have mixed outcomes versus mid-range hotels, signalling some -- but not complete -- consistency with the concept of disruptive innovation. Numerous practical and theoretical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Sharing economy platforms have become extremely popular in the last few years, and they have changed the way in which we commute, travel, and borrow among many other activities. Despite their popularity among consumers, such companies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful examples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and policy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a false dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any regulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no evidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from the Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out where and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing information with census and hotel data, we determine the socio-economic conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform. The reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the years. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional regulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why, finally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are responsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of ``algorithmic regulation''.},

Our purpose is to analyse whether or not the diversity of dwelling types correlate with the distribution of listings. We use a measure of spread based on entropy to indicate the diversity of dwelling types and look at its relationship with the distribution of Airbnb establishments, as well as the type of home ownership using correlation analysis. It is important to note that our study only considers domestic building types, and excludes any information on the diversity of land uses. Two important findings emerge from our analysis. Firstly, the spatial location of Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types, and positively correlated with a single dwelling type, which corresponds in general to purpose built flats, conversions and flats in commercial buildings. Secondly, Airbnb is associated with areas that have a high proportion of privately rented properties, detracting more than 1.4\% of the housing supply into short-term rentals. Such a phenomenon can reach up to 20\% in some neighbourhoods, further exacerbating the process of gentrification. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings as instruments to inform policies associated with the 'sharing' economy in relation to the disruption of the housing structure.},

  abstract = {This article identifies proxies which account for the impacts that the Airbnb platform is having on housing in Greater London. We identify these by analysing the relationships between possible Airbnb misuse and the attributes of housing in the same locations. We assume misuse when listings of entire properties within the Airbnb platform do not conform with local regulations and where hosts who offer such housing have multiple listings. In particular, we examine (1) the dwelling type based on building typology; (2) the type of housing tenure, whether it is owned or rented; and (3) the spatial distribution of changes in rent payable. Three important findings emerge from our analysis. First, based on 2018 data, we estimate that more than 2\% of all properties in London, and up to 7\% in some local areas are being misused through Airbnb as short-term holiday rentals. Second, the location of these particular Airbnb rentals is negatively correlated with the diversity of dwelling types and positively correlated with dwelling type such as an apartment (or flat) in areas of high private rental stock. Last, we show that a 100\% increase in the density of possible Airbnb misuse can be associated with up to an 8\% increase in unit rental price per-bedroom per-week, an equivalent to up to an average of \pounds 90 price increase per year. Finally, we discuss how this type of analysis can help build instruments to inform policies associated with the platform economy in relation to increasing polarisation in the London housing market.},

This article presents a framework for analyzing the relationship between short-term rentals and gentrification, an exploratory case study of New York City, and an agenda for future research. We argue that Airbnb has introduced a new potential revenue flow into housing markets which is systematic but geographically uneven, creating a new form of rent gap in culturally desirable and internationally recognizable neighborhoods. This rent gap can emerge quickly?in advance of any declining property income?and requires minimal new capital to be exploited by a range of different housing actors, from developers to landlords, tenants, and homeowners. Performing spatial analysis on three years of Airbnb activity in New York City, we measure new capital flows into the short-term rental market, identify neighborhoods whose housing markets have already been significantly impacted by short term, identify neighborhoods which are increasingly under threat of Airbnb-induced gentrification, and estimate the amount of rental housing lost to Airbnb. Finally, we conclude by offering a research agenda on gentrification and the sharing economy.},
