    "#### **Question 4: What are the likely pros and cons of the opposition’s proposal (for the Mayor, residents, and the city)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposition suggests raising council tax for some Airbnb hosts and \"professional landlords\". Our analysis agrees that Airbnb is part of London's housing problem, but shows that this particular tool/method is uneven.\n",
    "\n",
    "London is adding about 35k homes per year, while Airbnb adds 5–7.2k new listings a year – roughly 14–20% of annual housing output. A noticeable share of homes is being diverted to short-term lets rather than long-term housing. (citation)\n",
    "Based on our findings, short-term letting is much more profitable than long-term renting, giving owners a clear financial incentive to convert units to Airbnb. (citation) \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that \"Professional landlords\" have multiple entire-home listings and are active across the city, behaving like small hotel firms, not casual hosts. If we take the method of increasing council tax on professional landlords, we saw that under a simulated +40% council tax increase, most professional listings still make a healthy profit. The tax mainly bites lower-revenue hosts in outer boroughs, while high-revenue listings in central areas can easily absorb the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effects of the opposition proposal for different actors**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the Mayor**\n",
    ">**Pros:**\n",
    "> - The Mayor can claim he is \"Making Airbnb pay more\".\n",
    "> - Brings in some extra revenue that could be directed to enforcement or housing programmes.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Cons:**\n",
    ">- The proposal risks looking symbolic rather than practical.\n",
    ">- Politically, the proposal can be accused of being all hosts in cheaper areas face pressure, while well-capitalised operators in Westminster, Kensington & Chelsea, or Camden continue essentially unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the Residents:**\n",
    ">**Pros:**\n",
    "> - With the proposal, a few marginal listings may revert to long-term rentals, especially when profits are thin.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Cons:**\n",
    "> - The profit gap between Airbnb and long-term renting remains, and we can assume that most landlords will pay the higher tax and carry on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For the City:**\n",
    ">**Pros:**\n",
    "> - Some listings may disappear from the short-let market due to the proposal, which slightly eases pressure on specific neighbourhoods and pushes some tourist demand back towards hotels.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Cons:**\n",
    "> - The proposal targets council tax bands rather than the fundamental players: revenue and the number of listings per host.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Overall judgement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest that the Mayor should agree with the opposition but reject their tool; indicate a policy that would regulate host registration, enforce strict rental duration requirements, and implement primary-residence rules, with penalties for platforms and hosts that do not comply. We see these rules implemented in various cities around the world, such as New York with its Local Law 18 (citation) and Amsterdam with its 30-night cap and primary-residence requirement. (Municipality of Amsterdam, 2025), as well as in Paris, Barcelona, and many more (citation). \n",
    "\n",
    ">**This policy can combine revenue-based and volume-based taxation, enforce registration across platforms, impose strict 90-day enforcement, and impose strict bans on letting council and newly built housing. This will get us closer to that international standard and far more likely to shift power away from high-earning professional landlords and back towards residents.**"
